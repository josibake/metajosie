The idea is pretty simple: I wan't to have a way to log random datapoints and visualize them later. The simplest MVP was to log events using twitter to get the timestamp and location data and then push into elasticsearch.

## next steps
* Use something besides twitter
 * A simple iOS app would be nice
* add smarter data pre-processing with logstash (start\_time, stop\_time processing)
